# HubSpot.Extend() Workshop Day

Welcome to HubSpot.Extend()'s Workshop Day. Our workshop has three parts:
1. Setting Up Your Dev Environment
2. Creating a Custom Object
3. Leveraging Your Custom Object in a web app

**In Setting Up Your Dev Environment, we'll:**
1. Introduce you to VS Code.
2. Introduce you to the terminal and the HubSpot CLI.
3. Connect your local dev environment to your HubSpot account using the CLI.

**Then, we'll create a custom object by:**
1. Teaching you how to set up your own private app
2. Have you fork a GitHub repository which includes:
-- a JSON file with the Custom Object schema
-- a CSV file with demo custom object data
-- a completed index.js file
-- a package.json file
3. Teach users how to run the HubSpot CLI commands to create the custom object in their accounts
4. Teach users how to import the csv file into their accounts to create the demo data

**The third section will be leveraging the custom object in a hello world app**
1. Make sure all users have npm installed `npm install -g npm`
2. Teach users how to install node packages _they'll have the package.json file_ using `npm install`
3. Have users install HubSpot npm client `npm i @hubspot/api-client`
4. Teach users how to set up their node stuff
